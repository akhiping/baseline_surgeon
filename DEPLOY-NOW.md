## üîß If Build Fails

### Error: "Module not found"

**Solution:** Install dependencies locally first to test:
```bash
cd apps/playground
npm install
npm run build
```

If that works locally, try deploying again.

### Error: "Workspace dependencies not found"

**Solution:** Vercel needs monorepo setup. In Vercel dashboard:
- Go to Settings ‚Üí General
- Install Command: `cd ../.. && npm install && cd apps/playground && npm install`

Or build locally and deploy the `dist` folder only.

### Error: "Out of memory"

**Solution:** In `vite.config.ts`, add:
```typescript
build: {
  chunkSizeWarningLimit: 1000,
  rollupOptions: {
    output: {
      manualChunks: {
        monaco: ['@monaco-editor/react', 'monaco-editor']
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üé¨ Quick Test Commands

Before deploying, test locally:

```bash
cd apps/playground

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test dev server
npm run dev

# Test production build
npm run build

```

If all work locally, deployment will work!
